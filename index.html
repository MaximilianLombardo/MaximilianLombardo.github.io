        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a computational biologist and product manager with a passion for bridging the gap
          between scientific research and impactful products. My career has been shaped by working
          at the intersection of computational biology, product strategy, and modern life sciences
          R&D. I specialize in developing scalable pipelines for single-cell data analysis, 
          leveraging machine learning to uncover novel insights, and identifying high-value use
          cases for emerging technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside my technical pursuits, I am an avid creative coder fascinated by the intersection
          of aesthetics, algorithms, and human interaction. I enjoy building generative art installations,
          crafting interactive visual experiences, and exploring how data can drive unique artistic output.

        <h1>Professional Background</h1>
        <p>
          My path began with academic research in biotechnology and experimental therapeutics, where
          I honed my skills in genomics and statistical analysis. Moving from academia into industry, I 
          expanded my expertise in machine learning and data-driven discovery. During an international 
          research internship, I delved into advanced modeling techniques, focusing on multi-omics data 
          and disease phenotyping.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afterward, I joined a biotech startup environment, applying graph-based clustering and 
          dimensionality reduction methods to characterize and visualize single-cell data. Collaborating
          closely with cross-functional teams, I contributed to strategic partnerships and milestone 
          achievements in drug discovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          My passion for product development crystallized as I transitioned into a senior technical
          product role, driving the roadmap for large-scale open-source tools in single-cell and spatial 
          genomics. Working with engineers, UX specialists, and scientists, I developed and shipped 
          AI-driven features that significantly reduced data annotation bottlenecks. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I also dedicated efforts to building out an AI platform strategy, scoping MVP requirements 
          for model development and data processing pipelines. This blend of <strong>product vision</strong> and 
          <strong>technical expertise</strong> continues to fuel my motivation to create user-centric, cutting-edge 
          solutions for the life sciences community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside my industry roles, I have explored entrepreneurship, co-founding outreach programs 
          for high-tech ventures and conceptualizing SaaS products in the regenerative medicine sphere.
          My overarching goal is to champion <strong>innovation</strong> that advances both scientific research 
          and real-world impact.
